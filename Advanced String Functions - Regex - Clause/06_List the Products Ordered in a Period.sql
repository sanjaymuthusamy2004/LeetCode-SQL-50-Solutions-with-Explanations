### Example
**Input:**

Products table:
+-------------+-----------------------+------------------+
| product_id  | product_name          | product_category |
+-------------+-----------------------+------------------+
| 1           | Leetcode Solutions    | Book             |
| 2           | Jewels of Stringology | Book             |

| 5           | Leetcode Kit          | T-shirt          |
+-------------+-----------------------+------------------+

Orders table:
+--------------+--------------+----------+
| product_id   | order_date   | unit     |
+--------------+--------------+----------+
| 1            | 2020-02-05   | 60       |
| 1            | 2020-02-10   | 70       |
| 2            | 2020-01-18   | 30       |
| 2            | 2020-02-11   | 80       |
| 3            | 2020-02-17   | 2        |
| 3            | 2020-02-24   | 3        |
| 4            | 2020-03-01   | 20       |
| 4            | 2020-03-04   | 30       |
| 4            | 2020-03-04   | 60       |
| 5            | 2020-02-25   | 50       |
| 5            | 2020-02-27   | 50       |
| 5            | 2020-03-01   | 50       |
+--------------+--------------+----------+

**Output:**
+--------------------+---------+
| product_name       | unit    |
+--------------------+---------+
| Leetcode Solutions | 130     |
| Leetcode Kit       | 100     |
+--------------------+---------+

### Approach
1. **Join** `Products` with `Orders` on `product_id`.  
2. **Filter** rows where the year is `2020` and the month is `02`.  
3. **Group by** `product_id` to sum up total units.  
4. Use `HAVING` to select only products with total units â‰¥ 100.

SELECT
    p.product_name ,
    SUM(o.unit) AS unit 
FROM Products AS p

JOIN Orders AS o 
USING (product_id)

WHERE YEAR(o.order_date) = '2020' AND MONTH(o.order_date) = '02'

GROUP BY p.product_id
HAVING SUM(o.unit) >= 100;
